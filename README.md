## Inspiration and Background Info
This project, **Rams-Rocket**, is essentially inspired by the recent heated tech topic about SpaceX's rocket launches and Boeing's failure on NASA's next-gen rocket development. We deeply felt that an easy-accessible educational game is needed as an educational tool for people to gain a brief understanding about rocket and the technologies behind it. After deep review of the existing products on the market, we felt that an educational simulator game is a more favorable way to attract users, as the interactive element was proven to be beneficial on enforcing learning experiences, hence the Rams-Rocket project came alive.
